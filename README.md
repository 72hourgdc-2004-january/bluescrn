    Requires a reasonably fast PC with 3D hardware. 

    Apparently runs OK on an ATi Rage Pro!
    Also tested on a GF4 4600 and a Radeon Mobility 9200.


    Gameplay:
    ----------------
    Arrow keys to move
    Space to reset things when you get stuck!

    Eat all the chocolate!

    No. There isn't a high resolution mode. We like the retro low-res look!
    And the textures weren't big enough to look good in high res :)

    IMHO the 16bpp mode looks best on recent NVidia cards - they do nice dithering.
